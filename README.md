# ETL-Project-2020
In this project, due to social distancing and the virtual upcoming NFL Draft, we have been tasked to evaluate the First Round Draft Picks over the last 10 years and determine what positions the players played, what colleges they attended, and the individual conference of those individuals selected.  Data has been obtained from various sites to help develop the data set.  We will migrate this data to a production data base that will make it possible as a reference point as teams evaluate and make a determination on draft picks for the first-ever virtual draft in 2020. Ultimately, we are looking at the trends on how team are drafting.  

In the Data Cleanup & Analysis, we are going to perform ETL on the data. Make sure to plan and document the following:

* The sources of data that you will extract from.
* The type of transformation needed for this data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc).
* The type of final production database to load the data into (relational or non-relational).
* The final tables or collections that will be used in the production database.

As part of the task assigned, we will be submitting a final technical report with the above information and steps required to reproduce our ETL process.

In the final project report, we will include the following: 

* **E**xtract: your original data sources and how the data was formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin 4, etc).
* **T**ransform: what data cleaning or transformation was required.
* **L**oad: the final database, tables/collections, and why this was chosen.

Report will be uploaded and submit a link to Bootcampspot.
